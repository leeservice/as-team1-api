# as-team1-api project

# PROBLEM STATEMENT

# Currently, within Kainos there is not one source of truth
# to view job roles and the relevant information attached
# (e.g. job descriptions, capability, competencies, banding etc)
# this can be confusing and time-consuming for employees to retrieve
# the relevant job role information.

# VISION

# An online job application that serves both Kainos employees and
# recruitment admin to retrieve and update job roles and their relevant
# information.

# This repository covers all backend code required within a two-week sprint.

# Tests can be ran locally by running the series of
# J-unit and integration tests within the 'test folder'.
# Mocking tests are performed by Mockito.
